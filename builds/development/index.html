                <h3>She has been a graphic designer for 9 years now. She has witnessed the market changing very dynamically due to extremely fast technology development.</h3>
                <p>Started her career path as a book and newspaper designer she only had to deal with a print related restrictions and deliver pixel perfect solutions. When it was obvious that print was leaving room to digital she couldn’t help herself not to put her interest in the new, fast growing and dynamic area. She immediately started to learn. Designing graphics for RWD websites soon became her full-time job.</p>

                    <h2>Self-learned Developer</h2>
                    <h3>Everyday contact and close cooperation with developers had shown her how important it is for them to know at least basics of theory of graphic design and for her to know what are the restrictions and boundaries she should't have been pushing. </h3>
                    <p>As she kept learning she noticed that user experience centered design shares similar rules to the ones she went by in her print works. Web grid is nothing more than newspaper grid. CSS works exactly like InDesign’s paragraph or object styles. It is all the same, only the rules are different. It was the moment she decided she wants to learn something completely new, but where she could also use the knowledge she has already gained. This "journey" had already begun and now, knowing HTML, CSS and learning Javascript, she would love to have an opportunity to use this knowledge working with you.</p>
