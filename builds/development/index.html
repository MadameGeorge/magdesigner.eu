        <p>I've been a graphic designer for 9 years now. I have witnessed the market changing very dynamically due to extremely fast technology development. Started my career path as a book and newspaper designer I only had to deal with a print related restrictions and deliver pixel perfect solutions. When it was obvious that print was leaving room to digital I couldn’t help myself not to put my interest in the new, fast growing and dynamic area. I immediately started to learn. Designing graphics for RWD websites soon became my full-time job.</p>

        <h2>Self-learned Developer</h2>
        <h3>Everyday contact and strong cooperation with developers had shown me how important it is for them to know at least basics of theory of graphic design and for me to know what are the restrictions and boundaries I should not have been pushing. </h3>
        <p>As I kept learning I noticed that user experience centered design shares similar rules to the ones I went by in my typography works. Web grid is nothing more than newspaper grid. CSS works exactly like InDesign’s paragraph or object styles. It is all the same, only the rules are different. It was the moment I decided I want to learn something completely new, but where I could also use the knowledge I have already gained. This "journey" had already begun and now, knowing HTML, CSS and Javascript, I would love to have an opportunity to work with you.</p>
